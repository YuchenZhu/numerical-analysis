# numerical-analysis
Numerical analysis of partial differential equations, the following topics are treated:
- Discretization errors in numerical computing with finite differentiable terms.
- Solutions on uniform and nonuniform mesh.
- Error convergence with respect to the mesh size.
- Solve poisson equations with FD, FVM, FEM.
- Spatial discretization and time integration scheme, Forward/Backward Euler Method, three-point time-stepping, Newton-Raphson methods, Back-Eurler-Picard method.
- Stability analysis for different numerical schemes.
- Application to solve thermal diffusion equation, wave equation, 2D Fisher equation.
